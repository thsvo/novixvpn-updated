              <p>
                Welcome to Novix VPN. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of our website, applications, and
                VPN services (collectively, the "Service") operated by Novix VPN ("we", "us", or "our").
              </p>
              <p>
                By accessing or using our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part
                of the Terms, you may not access the Service.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Subscriptions</h2>
              <p>
                Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a
                recurring and periodic basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of each period, your subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless
                you cancel it or we cancel it.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may cancel your subscription either through your online account management page or by contacting our
                customer support team.

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Free Trial</h2>
              <p>
                We may, at our sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may be required to enter your billing information to sign up for the free trial. If you do, we will
                not bill you until the free trial has expired. On the last day of the free trial period, unless you
                cancel your subscription, we will automatically bill you for the applicable subscription fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the free
                trial offer, or (ii) cancel such free trial offer.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Fee Changes</h2>
              <p>
                Novix VPN, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the subscription fees. Any subscription
                fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an
                opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your continued use of the Service after the subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your
                agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.
